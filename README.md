Mounting bracket to attach a Wii/Wii U sensor bar to the inside of an Ikea Besta unit.

The bracket is designed to sit at the top of the unit. The sensor bar cable has just enough room to pass through to a slot on the rear of the bracket (with a bit of force), where it can be routed into the unit. The sensor bar slots into the space on the end.

Add double-sided tape to the top to attach it firmly to the top of the unit.

You'll need to print two of these - simply mirror the design in your slicer for the second one.

I printed mine with the screw section flat on the bed - while this is weaker, it provides a cleaner interior. This is important to ensure the end of the sensor bar cable will fit through. Strength isn't really a concern, given the weight of the sensor bar and intended mounting location.

An STL file is provided for direct slicing, with the original Blender file also included should you wish to make modifications to the design.
